<title>ppwcode l10n Vernacular: resource bundles</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This library offers a way of working with resource bundles in the context of internationalization.
  The main point of the library is that the <em>strategy</em> that is used to find resources in the
  desired locale, depends on the context in which we are working. Notably, what the desired locale
  is, and to which locale(s) we want to have a fall-back, and with which algorithm we want to find
  that fall-back, differs substantially. In desktop applications, e.g., we can assume that the
  desired locale is the locale of the operating system, which we can inspect using system properties.
  In a server based context, using the locale of the operating system is not an option, since many
  different users connect remotely to the server, each with their own distinct locale preference.
  For web applications, this preference travels with each http request in the header, and web
  development frameworks each have their own way of translating this in a different resource bundle
  loading strategy. For a faceless backend application, there are no existing general rules.</p>
<p>This library does not offer an implemented strategy for each of those contexts, but in the first
  place a framework to deal with the issue. Implementations of some resource bundle load strategies
  are offered here, but more specialized strategies can be found in other, more technology-dependent
  ppwcode vernaculars.</p>
