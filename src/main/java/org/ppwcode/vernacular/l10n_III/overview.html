<p>This library offers and defines a way of implementing localization.  Firstly, the library offers
  mechanisms to determine the desired locale and algorithms to determine fall-back locales if the
  desired locale is not available.  Secondly, the library offers a framework to implement the
  localization of POJOs and their properties and exceptions.  And finally, the library offers
  mechanisms to make localizations available to remote clients.</p>

<p>A part of the library is focused on working with resource bundles in the context of
  internationalization.  The main point of that part is that the <em>strategy</em> that is used to
  find resources in the desired locale, depends on the context in which we are working. Notably,
  what the desired locale is, and to which locale(s) we want to have a fall-back, and with which
  algorithm we want to find that fall-back, differs substantially. In desktop applications, e.g.,
  we can assume that the desired locale is the locale of the operating system, which we can inspect
  using system properties.  In a server based context, using the locale of the operating system is
  not an option, since many different users connect remotely to the server, each with their own
  distinct locale preference.  For web applications, this preference travels with each http request
  in the header, and web development frameworks each have their own way of translating this in a
  different resource bundle loading strategy. For a faceless backend application, there are no
  existing general rules.  This library does not offer an implemented strategy for each of those
  contexts, but in the first place a framework to deal with the issue. Implementations of some
  resource bundle load strategies are offered here, but more specialized strategies can be found in
  other, more technology-dependent ppwcode vernaculars.</p>
